1. React is a component based framework based on JSX
2. Components are re-usable blocks of HTML, CSS, and JS code. 
    a. This gets into the core rule of code
        - DRY DONT REPEAT YOURSELF
3. React uses a declarative approach to build components
    a. Declarative means you define the desired END state of the DOM, and React
        will figure out which elements on the page needs to be updated. You DONT
        have to write step by step instructions like you would with JS.

///////////// Creating a new react project //////////////
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
1. to create a new project:
    - npx create-react-app <project-name>
2. We will start with a more basic react app from the course materials
    - Download the lecture zip file and run npm install for the dependencies
    - That doesnt work anymore I guess. So create react app it is.
