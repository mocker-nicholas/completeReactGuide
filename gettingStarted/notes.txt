1. React enables us to make single page web applications without
    doing much of the heavily lifting we would otherwise have to do if 
    we were using vanilla JS for all of the DOM manipulation. 
2. The idea behind single page apps is to make it look like you are switching pages to the user, 
    but you are really just manipulating the DOM with react and JS.
