1. You can conditionally render content within JSX blocks of code. 
 - return (
     <div>
        {if(condition){
            <SomeComponent/>
        } else {
            <OtherComponent>
        }}
    </div>
 )

 2. if you are rendering and array of items, add a "Key" attribute to the
    custom component you are rendering. This helps react determine what you
    already have rendered, and will now only update the new item in the array.
